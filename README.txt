Approach:

- Read in the cipher text
- Separate the cipher text into single columns
- Sort cipher text single columns into correct order based on transposition key
- Store frequency analysis results as well as letter pairs (Map<String, Integer>)
- Use frequency analysis results to distribute alphabet
- If frequency analysis numbers differ only by one (i.e. 6 and 5, or 5 and 4, not 6 and 4), include the letters in both
    - (ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED) It is difficult to switch from frequency number to frequencyString index (ie - 6 to 0, and this
      is because we may have a pair that is listed as 7 or 8 in frequency rather than 6, so it will be difficult to make a non-static
      comparison for when we need to switch to indexes...
- Construct phrase from alphabet created
- Permutate over all combinations of letters available to each letter pair
    - Have two loops - one that handles the permutation of the parts of the alphabet, the other that handles the permutation of the     
      letters of the alphabet
    - (ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED) Make sure that the permutation of the "parts" of the alphabet only continue to the letters if 
      they are allowed to. (ie - if FF has frequency of [6, 5] only allow access to indexes [0, 1]. 

Ideas:

â€” For frequency analysis numbers that differs only by one, distribute the alphabet by numbers. That is, when we come upon a frequent letter pair of 6, and there is another that is 5, assign 0 and 1 to both of these. Then when we permutate over the list (Possibly list of lists?) we can see that we will be using 0 as well as 1 index of the frequent strings and then we can run the length of each frequent string.
